    <h2>
        Reconstructing Early Circus: A Database of Entertainments at Astley’s Amphitheatre, 1768-1833 </h2>

    <p>
        The origins of the genre we now know as “circus” can be traced back to the late 1760’s to the equestrian
        entertainments of Phillip Astley and his wife, Patty. Astley had served in the 15th Light Horse under General
        Elliott. Returning to England, Astley opened a Riding School, supplementing his income as an instructor by
        performing trick riding. With the profits from his shows, Astley was able to expand his enterprise over the next
        few years, offering performances in both Dublin (in 1773) and Paris (in 1774), moving to different site on
        Westminster Bridge Road, and adding a roof and a stage to his amphitheatre in 1779. Similar sites of
        entertainment soon sprung up within London and the British Isles as well as in Europe and North America. Astley
        never referred to his entertainments as “circus,” however. The term “circus” was originally introduced in the
        context of a rival venue, the Royal Circus, established in 1784, and was subsequently a dopted at other
        locations presenting equestrian performances mixed with other entertainments. </p>

    <p>
        The early entertainments at Astley’s consisted largely of feats of horsemanship by men, women and by children --
        but they also soon incorporated other novel acts such as automatons, acrobatics, a “learned horse” and bees
        swarming around their “trainer” in the shape of a wig. The performances were tailored to all classes, with
        Astley particularly assiduous to assure the comfort of the nobility. While music and song is not regularly
        represented in the early notices and advertisements for Astley’s, there are a few clues, however, that help us
        reconstruct a sense of the musical soundscape of his entertainments. The newspaper advertisement for July, 1772,
        for example, notes that Astley “rode on one Leg, and sound[ed] and Trumpet” and that he also rode two horses and
        “played a Tune on the Fife in full Speed.” </p>

    <p>
        In 1782, Charles Hughes, a former performer at Astley’s, partnered with Charles Dibdin to found the Royal
        Circus, Equestrian and Philharmonic Academy, which opened its doors less than one half a mile away from
        Astley’s. With a proscenium stage as well as a riding amphitheatre, the Royal Circus offered musical theatre
        along with the more spectacular acts. (The music and songs were designed to serve the purpose of avoiding the
        ire of the legitimate theatres and the eye of the magistrates. As David Worrall succinctly suggests, “musicality
        was the key element defining legality” during a time when only licensed theatres were legally allowed to present
        spoken-word dramas. The Circus overstepped its mark, however, and Hughes -- and then Astley -- was briefly
        jailed for presenting drama without a license. Both were eventually released and granted permission to operate,
        but the result was that Astley, too, started incorporating burlettas and pantomimes into his entertainments in
        an attempt to keep up with his competition. On Easter Monday, 1784, Astley’s opened under the altered name, “The
        Royal Grove,” with two new acts: a “comic ballet” entitled “The Peasants of the Alps” and a concluding
        pantomime, “Jupiter in Disguise; Or, the Rape of Europa.” (Eventually, Dibdin himself would leave the Royal
        Circus and write musical theatricals for Astley.) </p>

    <p>
        The more prominent role of song that accompanied the changes at Astley’s reflected and reinforced an increasing
        taste for novelty and for celebrity culture in the entertainment business. Accordingly, songs and singers began
        to get prime real estate in the advertisements and on the playbills for the shows at Astley’s, while particular
        songs were noted in the advertisements because they were already popular with the audience or because they were
        associated with particular celebrity singers. </p>
