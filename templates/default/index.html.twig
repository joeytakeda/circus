                    <p>The genre we know today as “circus” can be traced back to the equestrian performances of Phillip
                        Astley and his wife, Patty, at Ha’penny Hatch, Lambeth in the late 1760’s. While the first
                        spectacles at what would become known as Astley’s Amphitheatre and Riding School consisted
                        largely of feats of horsemanship, the nightly entertainments soon came to incorporate acts such
                        as acrobatics, musical automatons, a “learned horse,” trained bees swarming around their
                        “trainer” in the shape of a wig, pantomimes, fireworks, hot air balloons, comic songs and
                        re-enactments of occasions like the storming of the Bastille. In short, the performances at
                        Astley’s offered a public space which re-presented the latest novelties as well as current
                        events, re-mixing them along with a variety of astonishing physical entertainments. Given its
                        huge popularity, it was small wonder that Astley’s inspired rival circus sites within London and
                        the rest of the British Isles as well as in Europe and North America.</p>
                    <p>This website provides a searchable database of newspaper advertisements listing the featured acts
                        at Astley’s from 1768-1833. It takes us back to an era before the circus became synonymous with
                        wild animals and ring-leaders in order to help us learn more about this neglected popular
                        entertainment, early circus, and about the age in which it flourished.</p>
